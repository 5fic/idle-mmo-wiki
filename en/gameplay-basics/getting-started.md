Let's move on to the essentials and start your gaming adventure!

## Skills

Skills are the cornerstone of IdleMMO, enabling progress even while you're away from your device — true to the idle gaming genre.

- Navigate to the `Mining` page via the `Skills` dropdown menu.
- You’ll see various ores you can mine in your vicinity. Start with `Coal Ore` by clicking on it and selecting `Mine`.
- Set in motion! For the next 80 minutes, or 120 if you're a member, your character will mine autonomously. Feel free to leave the page; your gathered ore will wait for you in your inventory.

Simple, isn't it?

**Pro Tip:** Explore new locations to discover different ores.

## Hunting and Battling

Engaging in battle within IdleMMO begins with the hunt for enemies. This process is straightforward and sets the stage for your combat encounters.

- To start, navigate to the `Battle Page` and click `Start Hunt`. This initiates the hunting phase.
- Upon completion, a selection of enemies will appear on the page. Simply press on an enemy and then `Battle` to initiate the fight. Choose your opponent wisely, taking care not to engage with enemies out of your league, as enemies significantly stronger than your character may be impossible to defeat.

**Pro Tip:** Enhance your gameplay by improving your Hunting Mastery level. A higher level in this skill increases the variety of enemies you encounter during hunts, giving you more options for battle.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now mastered the basics of hunting and battling in IdleMMO. With just a few clicks, you can set your character on a path of adventure while you manage other tasks.
