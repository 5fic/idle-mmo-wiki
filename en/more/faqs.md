### Why are there game updates without corresponding patch notes?

Occasionally, updates are rolled out that primarily involve modifications to the game's backend code or infrastructure. These adjustments are crucial for maintaining the game's performance and stability but don't directly impact gameplay or player experience. As such, we don't usually publish patch notes for these updates, since they don't offer changes or information that would be relevant or noticeable to players.
