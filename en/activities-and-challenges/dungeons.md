# Dungeons

Dungeons in the game serve as a means to passively engage in combat for extended durations, without necessitating direct player interaction as with battling enemies. Moreover, they function as the primary source for acquiring recipes, which, in turn, enable the crafting of strongest items.

The game features various dungeons, each with differing levels of difficulty. As a dungeon's level rises, so does its difficulty, resulting in a reduced chance of success. The likelihood of completing a dungeon successfully is contingent upon the combined total of the player's protection and attack power.

Each dungeon comprises multiple floors, depicted in the action bar, representing the player's ongoing idle actions. Upon clearing all floors of a dungeon, it automatically concludes, granting rewards if applicable.

Participating in dungeons demands a significant investment of both time and currency to obtain the most formidable items. As dungeon levels escalate, so do the associated costs in both gold and time.
