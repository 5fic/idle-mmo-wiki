# World Bosses

World Bosses represent a key game feature where players collaborate to vanquish a shared adversary, reaping experience and exclusive rewards in return.

Scattered throughout Solaris Isle, diverse World Bosses present varying levels of challenge. While some require a considerable time investment to overcome, the duration of each battle generally aligns with the boss's combat level, albeit not strictly adhering to this guideline.

Following a successful defeat, a cooldown period ensues before the boss respawns, typically commensurate with its combat level.

World Boss encounters serve as the primary means to acquire [Pet Eggs](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types), crucial items enabling players to obtain pets once the incubation period elapses.
