# Campaigns

Campaigns in IdleMMO offer a no-cost battle pass experience, allowing players to earn a variety of rewards, including tokens and exclusive skins. There are two main campaign types to engage with:

#### Global Campaigns

- **Availability:** These are the staple campaigns of IdleMMO, accessible anytime but only active for a span of 2 to 3 months.
- **Rotation:** Once a campaign's time is up, a new global campaign takes the stage.

**Pro Tip:** Don't worry about missing out; you can revisit any previous global campaign at your leisure.

#### Seasonal Campaigns

- **Timing:** These campaigns are aligned with seasonal festivities such as Halloween, Winter Holidays, Easter, Valentines, etc., and are strictly time-bound.
- **Exclusivity:** Once a seasonal campaign concludes, it's not possible to return to it.

**Features of Seasonal Campaigns:**
- They offer unique rewards and skills pertinent to the season.
- For instance, in the `Eve of Shadows` campaign, you can collect `Pumpkins` and exchange them for `Campaign Points` and rewards.
- These collectibles are acquired through skill-based activities, but first, your character must venture to the event-specific location, available only during the campaign.


**Pro Tip:** Maximize your Campaign Points in the seasonal events by focusing on tasks that demand more attention. 

Building a `Snowman`, for instance, yields higher points compared to simple `Snowball` trading. This is by design, as activities requiring greater effort, like gathering materials for `Snowman`, are more rewarding in the campaign. Keep in mind, the extra effort pays off in a substantial points boost!
