# Hunting and Battling

### Hunting

Before engaging in combat, you'll need to track down a group of enemies by hunting them. The quantity you can encounter is directly linked to your [Hunting Mastery](/wiki/character/skills) skill level. Meanwhile, your [Movement Speed](/wiki/character/stats) stat determines how swiftly you can hunt these mobs.

### Battle

Once you've located a mob, you can start a battle by selecting an enemy and clicking `Battle`. Exercise caution; taking on an adversary of a higher level may lead to defeat.

### Chaining Enemies

You're not restricted to facing just one opponent at a time; your ability to queue up enemies depends on your `Combat Level`. Starting at Combat Level 1, you can queue up to __3__ enemies, and as your combat level increases to 100, you'll be able to queue up to __10__ enemies.

If you're already in combat, simply select another enemy and click `Battle` again. The game will line up your next battles, automatically progressing to the next fight after your current one concludes.   

#### Notes

- You are able to send your pet to hunt on your behalf when you reach a `Pet Mastery` level of __40__.
